Assignment: Build a Simple Contact Management System

In this assignment, you will create a basic Contact Management System where users can store, view, update, and delete contact information. 

 Application Requirements:
1. Add Contact via a Form:
Create a form that allows users to add a new contact. The form should include the following fields:
First Name (Text input)
Last Name (Text input)
Email (Email input)
Phone Number (Text input)
Address (Text input)

2. View Contacts:
The homepage should list all saved contacts. Each contact should display:
First Name
Email
Phone Number

Clicking on a contact’s name should take the user to a detailed view where they can see the contact’s full information (including Last Name , address).

3. Edit Contact:
Add functionality for users to update the contact details. All fields should be editable.
The "Edit Contact" page should have a form prefilled with the contact’s current information.

4. Delete Contact:
Users should be able to delete any contact from the system.

5. Search Contacts:
 Add a simple search functionality that allows users to search for contacts by name or email.

6. Superuser Login:
    Create a superuser with the following login details:
      Username: `admin`
      Password: `123`

 Notes:
 Ensure that when a contact is added, the user is redirected to the homepage where they can view the list of all contacts.
 Provide proper routing for easy navigation between the homepage, adding, editing, and deleting contacts.
 Implement basic form validation to ensure all required fields are filled out.
